# Bear-Package-Management
Some Basic Info about BPM (Bear-Package-Management).

## What is Bear-Package-Management
Right now, BPM is an in-progress package manager that will be a Bear-Shell extension that you can install seperatly with Bear-Shell.

## How will BPM work?
Each package will have their own repository inside of BPM. This is simple for easy and simplier development. This may change in the future.

## How can I get BPM?
At the current moment, you are not able to get BPM. We will release test packages and the ability to install from the Bear-Shell terminal soon.

## Usage
The planned way BPM will be used to install packages is like any other, ```bpm install <package>``` ```bpm remove <package>``` and others.
